# GermanClinicalTM

As a lot of valuable information is not stored in machine-readable format, we built up information extraction pipelines to mine German medical reports.  
Because of a limited training data availability, the pipelines follow a rule-based approach making use of UIMA Ruta [1].    
Due to data privacy, we can unfortunately not publish our data.
